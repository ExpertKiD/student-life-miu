    "We implemented two versions of the CNN architecture, one with MaxPooling layers and the other with AveragePooling layers. Both models followed the same architecture as described in Task 1, with the only difference being the type of pooling layers used. We trained each model for 5 epochs and recorded their training and validation performance across epochs. We also evaluated both models on the test set and measured their accuracy and training time.\n",

    "ii. **Training Time:** Varies based on hardware, but typically longer compared to MaxPooling due to the larger computational overhead of averaging.\n",
    "iii. **Training Dynamics:** The model achieved a high test accuracy of approximately 98.71%. It showed a steady increase in both training and validation accuracy over epochs, indicating effective learning. However, the training time was relatively longer compared to the MaxPooling model due to the computational overhead of averaging.\n",

    "iii. **Training Dynamics:** The model achieved a slightly higher test accuracy of approximately 99.00% compared to the AveragePooling model. Similar to AveragePooling, it showed a steady increase in both training and validation accuracy over epochs. However, the training time was shorter compared to AveragePooling due to the simpler operation of taking the maximum value.\n",

    "Both pooling strategies, MaxPooling and AveragePooling, resulted in high test accuracies, indicating their effectiveness in learning relevant features from the MNIST dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "MaxPooling generally showed a slight advantage over AveragePooling in terms of test accuracy and computational efficiency. This can be attributed to the fact that MaxPooling preserves the most prominent features while discarding less relevant ones, which may lead to better discrimination between classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "AveragePooling, although slightly slower in training compared to MaxPooling, still performed admirably well, demonstrating its ability to capture and summarize spatial information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between MaxPooling and AveragePooling may depend on specific requirements such as computational resources, model interpretability, and the nature of the dataset. While MaxPooling is computationally efficient and commonly used in practice, AveragePooling may offer a smoother representation of features and could be preferred in certain scenarios."
