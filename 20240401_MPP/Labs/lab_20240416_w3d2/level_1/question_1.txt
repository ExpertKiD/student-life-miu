1.	Short answer
a.	Name the differences between imperative and functional programming

- Functional programming are declarative in nature i.e. they focus on what to do as compared to imperative programming
that focus on how to do things.
- Function have referential transparency i.e. two calls to the same method will always result in same outcome which
may be modified in imperative programming.
-

b.	Explain the meaning of declarative programming. Give an example.

Declarative programming means focusing on what to do rather than how to do it. For e.g. a stream of students filtered by
their GPAs greater than 3.5. You don't need to know how to do it, you know what to do. The result will always be the same
requirements.

c.	Name the benefits of including functional style programming in Java

The benefits of functional style programming is that it is easier to read the program. And things that take very long
and tedious amount of code can be simplified in a single line.
