Write in a document why it is that we donâ€™t need eager loading anymore and the Application still
works with lazy loading. 


Answer:

Lazy loading loads the data in the memory when the attribute is accessed. We earlier got the error 
because we tried to access it after the entityManager session closed.

Now, we have made the whole class @Transactional. This means that the whole class is now transactional 
and each public method run in a transaction. So, the session is open when we are trying to access the 
lazy properties. Hence, we do not get the error.
